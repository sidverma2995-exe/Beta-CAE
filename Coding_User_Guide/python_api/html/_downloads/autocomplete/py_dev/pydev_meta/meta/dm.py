		the server id of the object contained to the
		connected DM root. The file/folder will be
		attached under an attribute of this object.

	folder_name : str, optional
		the name of the folder in the Library Items,

def GetAttributesFromUniqueRepresentations(server_id: Any, type: str, values: dict, ask_sdm: bool, object_id: Any) -> list[dict]:

	"""

	This function will return all Properties/Attributes for a specific input, 
	either server ids, a filter or a DM Browser window item.

	Parameters
	----------
	server_id : Any, optional
		The server id of the DM Object, or a list with server ids, if it is already known.
		Required even though it's optional.

	type : str, optional
		The type of the DM Object. The specified type can be ANSA type
		(e.g. ANSA_LOADCASE) or the DM type defined through the Data
		Model (e.g. Loadcase).

	values : dict, optional
		A dictionary which holds a filter (names - values)
		that will be used when no server ids or object ids are defined.

	ask_sdm : bool, optional
		In case of SDM CONSOLE, we can query the already downloaded values
		instead of querying DM. It should be used in cases where the query is expected 
		to be very slow.

	object_id : Any, optional
		When this function is called through an action in DM Browser or SDM CONSOLE,
		object_id is the GUI item's id, or a list with object ids. It can be used when 
		we don't know the server_id.

	Returns
	-------
	list[dict]
		Returns a list with dictionaries, with the specified attribute values. 
		If the function fails, the list will be empty.

	Notes
	-----
	All arguments are optional, but a specific combination needs to be defined in
	order for the function to work.
	Either the server_id/server_ids need to be defined,
	or the values or the object_id/object_ids.
	If none of the above are defined, the function will not work.

	expr : str
		Is the EL epxression leading from the given object to the file to be transfered. Care has to be taken that only one file is referenced, e.g. files.model, file.pom_ExportedData.

	extension : str
		The extension that will be added to the downloaded file.
		SimManager will not add any extension, therefore it's up to the user to define it.

	dm_root : str, optional
		The target DM root(URL). If not provided, the current DM is assumed.

	progress_bar : guitk.BCGuiObject, optional
		The progress can be shown in a BCProgressBar,

class DMReference():

	"""

	DM objects can refer to other objects within the same DM. Such relationships are
	described by 3 data fields:
	* DM Object that is doing the referring, i.e. is using another object
	* DM Object that is being referred to, i.e. is being used by another object
	* Reference type
	
	Instances of the DMReference class encapsulate all information needed to 
	describe such a reference between DM Objects.
	
	Based on the reference type, references can be classified as strong / weak:
	Objects cannot be deleted if there are any outstanding strong references
	pointing to them. Weak references on the other hand do not obstruct the deletion
	of the referred-to objects.
	
	Even though the reference type can be any arbitrary string, there are predefined
	reference types accomodating standard use cases. The predefined reference types
	are:
	* adaptation
	  Used for adapted DM objects to point to their standalone counterparts (e.g.
	  LoadCases) (strong)
	* creation
	  Used for DM objects to point to the DM object that triggered their creation
	  (e.g. Reports pointing to the META Session) (strong)
	* history
	  Used to show how objects have evolved over time and track their origins:
	  recent objects point to their immediate ancestors (weak)
	* repr_derivation
	  Used for automatically saved FE representation objects to point to the
	  original ANSA representation objects (weak)
	* changeset
	  Used for connecting an object in the DM, with the changeset that ordered its
	  creation (strong)
	* training
	  Used to show how data were used in ML training sessions: the generated 
	  predictor object points to the Simulation Run objects used during training
	  (weak)
	* modular_environment_profile
	  Used to show what configuration was used during the save of an object (strong)
	* strong
	  Generic strong reference. Recommended for user created references
	* weak

def OpenDMObjectsInNewTab(server_ids: list[str], type: str, view: str, dm_system: str, tab_name: str, expand_all: bool, open_in_viewer: bool, open_in_reports_table: bool) -> bool:

	"""

	This function can be used to open one or more hierarchies of any DM Object type,
	in a new tab, in DM Browser.

	Parameters
	----------
	server_ids : list[str], optional
		A list with DM Object server ids.

	type : str, optional
		The type of the DM Object, as it is defined through the Data Model
		(e.g. Loadcase).

	view : str, optional
		The new Tab's view, e.g. "Default", "Flat" or a user defined in the
		dm_views.xml. When undefined, the function will return False.

	dm_system : str, optional
		The DM root that will be queried.

	tab_name : str, optional
		The new tab will be given this name.

	expand_all : bool, optional
		If set to True, all items in the new tab will be expanded.

	open_in_viewer : bool, optional
		If set to True, all items in the new tab will be loaded to the meta viewer.

	open_in_reports_table : bool, optional
		If set to True, Reports Table will also be launched for all  the items in the
		new tab that is opened. In case the requested Type is not supported in
		Reports Table (SimulationModel, LoadCase, SimulationRun) or no Reports
		are found in DM for the requested server_ids, the scipt function will just 
		open the server_ids in a new tab and no Reports Table tabs will be opened.

	Returns
	-------
	bool
		Returns True if the tab is opened succesfully, otherwise False.

	Examples
	--------
	::

def QueryDMObjects(query: object, type: str, free_text_targets: object) -> dict:

	Search in DM for objects which satisfy the specified query.

	Parameters
	----------
	query : object
		The query can be expressed in one of the following forms:
		* A list of [<attribute_name>, <condition>, <value>] lists which
		  specify the query. For Attributes of Versioning Scheme Counter
		  type (e.g. Team Version, Study Version, etc.) the "Latest"
		  keyword is supported as follows:
		  [<versioning_attribute_name>, "equals", "Latest"]
		* A BetaQL string
		* A "free text" query string

	type : str, optional
		The type of the DM Object. The specified type can be ANSA type
		(e.g. ANSA_LOADCASE) or the DM type defined through the Data
		Model (e.g. Loadcase).

	free_text_targets : object, optional
		A list of the targets used in free text search queries 
		(e.g. ["All"] or ["Simulation_Run", "Report"])

	Returns
	-------
	dict
		Returns a dictionary with the following keys and values:
		key = 'error'
		value = 0(Success), 1(Nothing found), 2(No DM Root was set), 3(No access to DM Root),
		        4(Error in filters)
		key = 'output'
		value = A list with the DM objects which satisfy the query.

	Notes
