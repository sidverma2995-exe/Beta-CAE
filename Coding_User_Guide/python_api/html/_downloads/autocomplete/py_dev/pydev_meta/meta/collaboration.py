def ConnectToCollaborationServer(server_address: str, server_port: int) -> int:

	"""

	Sends a connection request to a META collaboration server. If META is already 
	connected to another server, then the user will be asked for closing current
	connection.

	Parameters
	----------
	server_address : str
		Address of the server; can be either IPv4 or IPv6.

	server_port : int
		Listening port of the server.

	Returns
	-------
	int
		Returns 1 if the request has been sent successfully, and 0 if not.

	Notes
	-----
	This function cannot provide feedback whether the META client has been 
	successfully connected. In order to check that, you may use the function
	IsConnectedToCollaborationServer().
