def AddAttachmentToFolder(entity: object, server_id: str, folder_name: str, filename: str, attribute_name: str, entity_type: str, link: bool) -> int:

	"""

	This function can be used to:
	- add a file under a folder in the Library Items,
	- attach a file/folder under a DM Object's attribute of type Attached File/Directory
	  respectively. If this attribute does not exist, it is created as Additional Attribute.
	A DM root should have been specified.

	Parameters
	----------
	entity : object, optional
		the ANSA entity to be found in the connected
		DM root. The file/folder will be attached under
		an attribute of this object (if found in DM).

	server_id : str, optional
		the server id of the object contained to the
		connected DM root. The file/folder will be
		attached under an attribute of this object.

	folder_name : str, optional
		the name of the folder in the Library Items,
		where the specified file will be attached.
		For DM Objects in file-based DM, a sub-folder
		with this name will be created, and the file
		will be placed there.

	filename : str
		the full path of the file/folder to be attached.

	attribute_name : str, optional
		the name of the DM Object's attribute where the

	entity_type : str, optional
		the type of the DM object.

	link : bool, optional

		its contents under a DM Object's attribute. By
		default, the contents are copied (False).

	Parameters
	----------
	server_id : str
		Is the ID of an object (id:tid). It can be used instead of an object type as a starting point. Then the expression will be evaluated in this object.

	expr : str
		Is the EL epxression leading from the given object to the file to be transfered. Care has to be taken that only one file is referenced, e.g. files.model, file.pom_ExportedData.

	extension : str
		The extension that will be added to the downloaded file.
		SimManager will not add any extension, therefore it's up to the user to define it.

	dm_root : str, optional
		The target DM root(URL). If not provided, the current DM is assumed.

class DMReference():

	"""

	DM objects can refer to other objects within the same DM. Such relationships are
	described by 3 data fields:
	* DM Object that is doing the referring, i.e. is using another object
	* DM Object that is being referred to, i.e. is being used by another object
	* Reference type
	
	Instances of the DMReference class encapsulate all information needed to 
	describe such a reference between DM Objects.
	
	Based on the reference type, references can be classified as strong / weak:
	Objects cannot be deleted if there are any outstanding strong references
	pointing to them. Weak references on the other hand do not obstruct the deletion
	of the referred-to objects.
	
	Even though the reference type can be any arbitrary string, there are predefined
	reference types accomodating standard use cases. The predefined reference types
	are:
	* adaptation
	  Used for adapted DM objects to point to their standalone counterparts (e.g.
	  LoadCases) (strong)
	* creation
	  Used for DM objects to point to the DM object that triggered their creation
	  (e.g. Reports pointing to the META Session) (strong)
	* history
	  Used to show how objects have evolved over time and track their origins:
	  recent objects point to their immediate ancestors (weak)
	* repr_derivation
	  Used for automatically saved FE representation objects to point to the
	  original ANSA representation objects (weak)
	* changeset
	  Used for connecting an object in the DM, with the changeset that ordered its
	  creation (strong)
	* training
	  Used to show how data were used in ML training sessions: the generated 
	  predictor object points to the Simulation Run objects used during training
	  (weak)
	* modular_environment_profile
	  Used to show what configuration was used during the save of an object (strong)
	* strong
	  Generic strong reference. Recommended for user created references
	* weak
